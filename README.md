# GOV.UK Prototype Kit starter prototype (unofficial)

A blank starter [GOV.UK Prototype Kit](https://prototype-kit.service.gov.uk) prototype, for online code editors such as:

 - [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces)
 - [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com)

This is especially useful if you cannot install the kit on your computer.

Read the [Get started guide for GitHub Codespaces](https://joelanman.com/posts/govuk-prototype-kit-github-codespaces/).

Alternatively you can clone or fork this repo and start from there.

This is a personal project and not officially supported by GDS.
